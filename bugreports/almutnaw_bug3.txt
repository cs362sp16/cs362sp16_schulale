Bug #3
CS362, Spring 2016
6 June 2016

The bug I found lies within the implementation of the adventurer card.
When an adventurer card is drawn in a fully functional version of Dominion, it will
reveal cards from the deck until 2 Treasure cards are found. Then the Treasure
cards will be placed into the user's hand and the other cards that were revealed
will be discarded. However, I discovered a bug that quits as soon as one Treasure
card is drawn rather than two. The issue appears to lie within the while loop and
can be fixed by replacing "1" with "2."

The priority of this bug is high because the game will product inaccurate results,
(the user will not receive as much Treasure), and the severity is medium because
the game may still be played.
