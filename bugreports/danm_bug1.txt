Bug #1
CS362, Spring 2016

The bug I found lies within the implementation of the card: smithyCardEffect
When a smithy card is drawn in a fully functional version of Dominion, it allows
three cards to be drawn. However, I discovered a bug that does not allow three
cards to be drawn, and the issue is appears to be within the for loop.

The priority of this bug is high because the game will product inaccurate results,
and the severity is medium because the game may still be played.
