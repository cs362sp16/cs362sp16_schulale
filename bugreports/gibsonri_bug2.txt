Bug #2
CS362, Spring 2016
6 June 2016

The bug I found lies within the implementation of the minion card.
When a minion card is drawn in a fully functional version of Dominion, it allows
the option to receive 2 gold or to draw 4 cards. Additionally, each other player
with at least 5 cards in hand discards the hand and draws 4 cards.
However, I discovered a bug that does not give the player 2 gold when that
option is selected.

The priority of this bug is high because the game will product inaccurate results,
and the severity is medium because the game may still be played.
