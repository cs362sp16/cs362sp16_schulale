I achieved 100% statement and branch coverage for the adventure card, which did not take long at all (less than 1 minute).
I was also able to get 100% coverage for council room in a short amount of time due to lack of branches.


I believe random tests are better than the unit tests in regard to finding obscure bugs that I would
not be able to think of, but does take more time as a result.
Unit tests are efficient at finding specific issues that are more likely to occur than those found with automated testing.
Unit tests are also easier to write and will less likely lead to as many false positives.
