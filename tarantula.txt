The file tarantula.py is my implementation of Tarantula for dominion.c.
It runs a test suite consisting of each unit test, using gcov on dominion.c and
recording information used to compute the suspiciousness of each coverage unit.
I used gcov to help identify the bug described in debugging.txt, and then I used
tarantula. I found Tarantula to be much more intuitive than gcov and especially
helpful with regard to setting breakpoints.
